# Getting Started

This guide will walk you through installing ML Container Creator (MCC), configuring MCC for first-time use, and the various methods to creating your first SageMaker-ready container.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- **Node.js 24.11.1+** - [Download](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Python 3.8+** - For model serving code
- **Docker 20+** - [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/), required for local builds
- **AWS CLI 2+** - [Install AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
- **AWS Role** - With an appropriately provisioned [AWS Identity and Access Management](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/) [policy document](#iam-policy-document)

### Verify Prerequisites

```bash
# Check Node.js version
node --version  # Should be 24.11.1 or higher

# Check Python version
python --version  # Should be 3.8 or higher

# Check Docker (local builds only)
docker --version

# Check AWS CLI
aws --version

# Verify AWS credentials
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

### IAM Policy Document
!!! todo "Coming Soon"
    Documentation for this feature is in progress.


## Installation

```bash
# Install Yeoman
npm install -g yo

# Install the generator
git clone https://github.com/awslabs/ml-container-creator.git
cd ml-container-creator

# Install Dependencies and Link Generator
npm install
npm link

# Verify installation
yo --generators
# Should show "ml-container-creator" in the list

# Run tests to verify setup (for contributors)
npm test

# Generate your project
yo ml-container-creator
```

## Predictive ML

Let's create a simple [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) model container. All predictive ML containers feature a very basic regression model trained on the [Abalone dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/1/abalone). These sample models are for demonstration purposes only. The instructions assume you have a model object saved locally to be copied to your container in the format specified for your chosen framework.

For LLMs, check out the section on [Generative AI](#generative-ai).

### Step 1: Prepare Your Model

First, save a trained model in the format you plan to use for your deployment. Each predictive framework supports different model format types. Check the "supported frameworks" page for more details.

!!! todo "Coming Soon"
    Link to predictive framework support page.

In this example, we'll use the sample Abalone classifier. This deployment option trains a light-weight and overly simplistic regression model using the selected predictive ML framework, and saves the model object in the format specified. The model file is automatically included in the container files for simplicity.

### Step 2: Generate Container Project

Run the generator using the `yo` command and selecting the generator from the provided list. Alternatively, specify the generator inline: `yo ml-container-creator`. You'll be prompted with questions. Each option creates conditional branching logic custom to the selected values. For a basic scikit-learn container using the default regression model, follow the prompts as defined below. You'll want to do this in a new directory.

```

⚠️  Warning: Building locally for SageMaker deployment
   Building this image locally may result in `exec format error` when deploying
   to SageMaker if your local architecture differs from the target instance.
   Ensure you have set the appropriate --platform flag in your Dockerfile
   (e.g., --platform=linux/amd64 for x86_64 instances, --platform=linux/arm64 for ARM).
   Consider using CodeBuild for architecture-independent builds.


📋 Project Configuration

🚀 Manual Deployment

☁️ The following steps assume authentication to an AWS account.

💰 The following commands will incur charges to your AWS account.
         ./build_and_push.sh -- Builds the image and pushes to ECR.
         ./deploy.sh -- Deploys the image to a SageMaker AI Managed Inference Endpoint.
                 deploy.sh needs a valid IAM Role ARN as a parameter.
   create scikit-test-project/Dockerfile
   create scikit-test-project/nginx-predictors.conf
   create scikit-test-project/requirements.txt
   create scikit-test-project/code/model_handler.py

#### Project Structure

Your generated project contains:

```

    ├── test_local_image.sh    # Test local container
    └── test_model_handler.py  # Unit tests
```

### Step 3: Add Your Model

If you have your own model saved in the `pkl` format, modify the generated Dockerfile accordingly.
```bash
# COPY sample_model/abalone_model.pkl /opt/ml/model/
COPY my_local_model/model.pkl /opt/ml/model/
```
The Dockerfile will be different based on the values selected in Step 2, but the step remains the same so long as you are supplying your own already trained model.

!!! info "Model Source Locations"
    At this time, predictive models can only be sourced from local storage.

### Step 4: Test the Container

This particular flow yields three different tests that can be run. The first is a test of the image build process, the second tests the model's ability to receive requests and respond, and the third tests the deployed endpoint using the [AWS SageMaker CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/sagemaker/).

!!! info "Testing Data"
    Data used to test these capabilities come directly from the Abalone dataset. It is not a true test of a model's predictive performance. Rather it is a test of the container's to serve inference, the model loader's `predict` method, and the endpoint's ability to receive requests on the `/invocations` endpoint. If you provide your own model, you may have to modify these scripts with your own test data.

This test builds the container locally and stands it up as a temporary process behind `localhost:8080`. It then sends a request to the `/ping` endpoint, followed by a request to the `/invocations` endpoint. 

#### Test Model Handler:
```bash

  ]
}
(base) frgud@842f5776eab6 scikit-test-project % 
```
This test executes the Python code that runs within the container. If you require custom input preprocessing and post-processing, you will have to modify the `code/model_handler.py` file. The model handler test can be extended to test how the container receives and responds to inference requests at the model layer.

#### Test Endpoint:
We will come back to this once we deploy the model in the next step.

## Generative AI

### Step 1: Generate Container Project
Just as with the [predictive scenario](#predictive-ml), we can use MCC to generate container assets for transformer-based architectures and LLMs. In this example, we'll use MCC to deploy [openai/gpt-oss-20b](https://huggingface.co/openai/gpt-oss-20b) onto a SageMaker AI managed inference endpoint using the [SGLang](https://docs.sglang.io/) serving framework.

### Step 2. Build the Container
The transformer based projects used managed containers from framework providers to build the final container. These containers take significantly longer to build given how large they are. It is recommended to use AWS CodeBuild for transformer-based containers. Building with AWS CodeBuild helps reduce the likelihood of architecture mismatches as well.

### Step 3. Deploy to SageMaker AI
Transformer based containers typically require GPU to successfully deploy. Take care to provision your transformer-based container onto the appropriate instance type. The deployment script is populated with a "best-guess" instance type, but you may try experimenting with the deployment instance based on your unique workload requirements.

## Configuration Options

The example above used interactive prompts, but ML Container Creator supports multiple configuration methods for different workflows:

### Quick CLI Generation

Skip prompts entirely using CLI options:

```bash
# Generate sklearn project with CLI options
yo ml-container-creator iris-classifier \
  --framework=sklearn \
  --model-server=flask \
  --model-format=pkl \
  --include-testing \
  --skip-prompts
```

### Environment Variables

Set deployment-specific variables:

```bash
export AWS_REGION=us-west-2
export ML_INSTANCE_TYPE=gpu-enabled
yo ml-container-creator --framework=transformers --model-server=vllm --skip-prompts
```

### Configuration Precedence

Configuration sources are applied in order (highest to lowest priority):

1. **CLI Options** (`--framework=sklearn`)
2. **CLI Arguments** (`yo ml-container-creator my-project`)
3. **Environment Variables** (`AWS_REGION=us-east-1`)
4. **Config Files** (`--config=prod.json` or `ml-container.config.json`)
5. **Package.json** (`"ml-container-creator": {...}`)
6. **Generator Defaults**
7. **Interactive Prompts** (fallback)

For complete configuration documentation, see the [Configuration Guide](configuration.md).

## Cleanup

To avoid ongoing charges, delete your SageMaker endpoint:

```bash
# Delete endpoint
aws sagemaker delete-endpoint --endpoint-name <ENDPOINT_NAME>

# Delete endpoint configuration
aws sagemaker delete-endpoint-config --endpoint-config-name <ENDPOINT_CONFIG_NAME>

# Delete model
aws sagemaker delete-model --model-name <MODEL_NAME>
```
