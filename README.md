  <p><em>Simplify your machine learning deployments on AWS SageMaker</em></p>

## Why ML Container Creator?

Deploying machine learning models to production shouldn't be complicated. ML Container Creator eliminates the complexity of creating SageMaker Bring Your Own Container (BYOC) inference endpoints, letting you focus on what matters most - your models.

**Perfect for:**
- Data scientists who want to deploy models without DevOps overhead
- ML engineers building production inference pipelines
- Teams standardizing their ML deployment process
- Organizations moving from prototype to production

## 🚀 Get Started in Minutes

```bash
# Install and run
npm install -g yo
npm link
yo ml-container-creator
```

Answer a few questions about your model, and get a complete, production-ready container with:
- Optimized inference server (Flask or FastAPI)
- Multi-framework support (sklearn, XGBoost, TensorFlow, Transformers)
- Built-in testing and deployment scripts
- AWS best practices baked in

## 🌟 Open Source & Community Driven

ML Container Creator is **100% open source** under the Apache 2.0 license. We believe the ML community thrives when tools are accessible, transparent, and collaborative.
